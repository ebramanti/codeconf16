## About Mike
- Works for CodeClimate, static analysis platform

## The Story
- Found some records in a box of junk
- In the record box, a notebook
- The Perfect Programming Language, by J. Piano

## The Language
- Type System
- Macros
- Data Queries
- Declarative, whether or not a person can write side-effect free code
- Concurrent - write sequential code, and make aspects of them apparently concurrent
- Distributed - handled by a key set of abstractions with robust scheduler
- Object-oriented
- Functional - clear obvious view between OO and functional
- Gradual Typing - soft types, "from scripts to programs"
- Data Types - available abstractions
- Pattern Matching
- Destructuring
- Data Structures
- Compiles to a small core language
- Portable
- Verifiable
- Syntax - important component

## None of this is true
- "Perfect" doesn't exist
- Lowercase "perfect" doesn't either

## Don't forget these
- Friendly errors
- Editor integration
- Package management
- Libraries
- Existing programs and idioms
- Documentation
- Testing

## The perfect programming language is the one you're using right now.

## What makes a language successful?
- Languages don't succeed because they're perfect
- Languages succeed because of people
- Languages succeed because of the communities we build and nourish
- Languages succeed because of the stuff we build
- Languages succeed because of the tools that we create to support them
